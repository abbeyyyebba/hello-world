# hello-world

Whatsup friends.

Abbey here. I am learning how to code and so far it's pretty fun. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, but I'm slowly trying to figure it out. I'm taking a Udemy course created by Dr. Angela Yu, and reading a book called HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett. 

I'm going to challenge myself to work on coding for 30 days by the end of 2020. Today is November 7th as I write this. I work a full time job in social services, so I don't have 24/7 to work on this. I find myself pretty burnt out by the end of the work day, so I am trying to balance learning something new (coding) with chilling out to let my mind have a break. That's where the 30 days of coding challenge comes in. Tomorrow will start week 1 of 8 before 2020 is over. In this 8 week period I need to work on coding for at least a total of 30 days, for at least 1 hour a day. No other rules, just need to get the time in. Then I'm sure I'll make up a new challenge to start off 2021, but I'm trying to not get ahead of myself. One step at a time.

So here we go.
