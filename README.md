# hello-world

Whatsup friends.

Abbey here. I am learning how to code and so far it's pretty fun. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, but I'm slowly trying to figure it out. I'm taking a Udemy course created by Dr. Angela Yu, and reading a book called HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett. 

I'm going to challenge myself to work on coding for 30 days by the end of 2020. Today is November 7th as I write this. I work a full time job in social services, so I don't have 24/7 to work on this. I find myself pretty burnt out by the end of the work day, so I am trying to balance learning something new (coding) with chilling out to let my mind have a break. That's where the 30 days of coding challenge comes in. Tomorrow will start week 1 of 8 before 2020 is over. In this 8 week period I need to work on coding for at least a total of 30 days, for at least 1 hour a day. No other rules, just need to get the time in. Then I'm sure I'll make up a new challenge to start off 2021, but I'm trying to not get ahead of myself. One step at a time.

So here we go.


November 9th.
I started blogging about this, learning to code. Not telling anyone about it. Just writing what I'm learning, my thoughts, whatever. It's only been two days of it, but it feels good to write it out, and it motivates me to keep going. I figured I'll feel good about learning this once it feels like I can explain it to someone else. So the blog is my someone else. I'll teach my blog what I know, and then maybe I'll actually feel like I'm learning, and not just bumbling along. I guess by writing this here, I'm doing the same thing. How embarrassing. But oh well! 

I need to learn how to use github. Like actually use it, and not just a little writing in here, like this, now and then. I like that it tracks the days that a person has been on here and writing code or working on a project. Makes me feel like I'm accomplishing something. I guess once I learn a little more about how to actually code, I'll figure out how to use this site. 

Til next time!
